   Hey there ðŸ‘‹
   
   I am Asmita Malakar, a growing front end and full stack developer. I have experience working with Python for data analysis projects along with intermediate skill in the Django framework. For web dev, I have worked with React Native along with HTML/CSS/JS, and AWS and firebase backend. Though I have worked with a variety of organizations in the past, I have a particular affinity for working with edtech nonprofit startups.

In the summer of 2021, I recieved the opportunity to work with a student led nonprofit called STEMchats to develop a website for their Blueprint subteam using HTML/CSS/JS (Jquery library) while learning about their firebase backend.
